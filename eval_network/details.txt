this netowrk is a p2p network.

In this evaluators are connected to each other, 

   when an evaluator is registerd for becoming a node, it accesses the register.hpp file to intitate the 
on-boarding process and receives a list IP's of the evaluator node from those evaluators who are 
always online.

Then the code keeps the node in always listening state.

Following are the task performed by the code for the n/w:
    - hardcoded list of always alive nodes(just for once) is extracted from
    the code.
    - pings all the always alive nodes to get the list of neighbouring
    nodes (happens only for once).
    - receives the list of all the other nodes (happens only for once).
    - sends continuously all the nodes a heatbeat signal after a particular
    interval.
    - receives the test and checks the test and makes a note of the score 
    incorrespondence to the students's Uid.
