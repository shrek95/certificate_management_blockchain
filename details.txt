In this work flow we have three elements to consider a student, an evaluator and a validator.
So a student submits the test to the application end and then the application forwards it to the network,
   the network has a leader being elected in every interval of time and that leader will take up the test paper.
every node has a list of IPs, segregated on the basis of technologies. Suppose every technology has atleast 100 faculties registered,

      
      These faculties play as the test validators, they check the test and genrate a certificate and race against the time to make a 
transaction and propose first in the network before any one else. As the transaction is sent ahead it is being cross referenced by the 
score of others in the technology and if the result is unanimous by more than 5 evaluators, the leader writes the transaction in 
the blockchain.
        
        Leaders are calculated amongst the 1k evaluators who have the credit as 1k
