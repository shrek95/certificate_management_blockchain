In this document, leader election is being done in which, a leader is elected by the 
process of taking random turns after confirmed trnasactional values , which means supposedly a 
node becomes leader after every two transaction and this leader has the following work to perform:

        - leader election is done totally randomly amongst the list of
        validators.
        - leader has to take the test file from the user and send it to all the
        nodes.
        - but before sending, it has to valdiate the authenticity of the user.
        - receive back the consensus result and forward it back to the other
        evaluators.
