In this document validator network logic is present.

    - Validators are those who have more then threshold votes as for example it
    is 1k.
    - Validators have four main tasks and they are:
        . Holds the blockchain.
        . Valiates transaction using the blockchain.(not literal Blockchain, matches it from key value
                pair of students).
        . confirm the leader about the validity of the transaction.
        . announce the block if valid to the leader.
                and if not valid send back the report for illegal transaction.
